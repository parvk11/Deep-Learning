This is a nueral network built from scratch to predict heart disease in patients based off of data form the Cleveland Hospital. 
I used the data from UCI's ML data repo. The final prediction gives a probability distribution of two classes: absence/presence of heart disease. 
I chose not to use libraries such as Tensorflow/Pytorch so I could really understand all of the math and theory behind a nueral network.
